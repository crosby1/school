                        <p>Here at Cliff Hangers we provide several levels of climbing instruction, all tailored to your individual strengths, interests, and comfort levels. You can start your lessons on small one- and two-pitch climbs and move up to longer routes. We cover everything from working with hand- and footholds to working with ice axes. Lessons are always under the watchful and encouraging eye of an experienced instructor. Special instruction is also available for those with special physical needs or requirements.</p>
